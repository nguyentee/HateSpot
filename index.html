            <br/>
            <p> The data we’re working with are the raw numbers of hate and bias-motivated incidents that were reported to the Ottawa Police. A police-reported hate crime is</p>
            </br>
            <h3>“defined as a criminal violation against a person or property motivated by hate, based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, or any other similar factor.”</h3>
            </br>
            <p>The crime statistics are published and accurate on the day that they were produced. The details include year, reported date & time, occurrence date, time & weekday, hate crime type, primary hate crime motivation, primary offence, CCJS clearance, location, Ottawa neighbourhood, City, and Ottawa police sector & division.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
          </br>
              <p>The number of hate and bias-motivated incidents have increased over the last few years with cases continuing to rise at rapid rates. The interactive map and bar graph below highlight the different police-reported hate and bias crime rates in various Ottawa neighbourhoods. The visualizations allow users to select a general location and/or input an address, and filter it by selecting a specific time period (years) and type of hate and bias-motivated incident. The visualizations and data presented on this page were created for policy-makers, police, educators, and other stakeholders that may be in a position to raise awareness and take the necessary steps to implement positive change. This data is also beneficial to current and potential Ottawa residents who may or may not be a part of targeted groups in order to bring awareness of what is happening within their communities, and to advocate and support one another.

            <h2>Task Analysis</h2>
            </br>
              <p>	Our interview began with discussing what neighbourhoods in Ottawa we were from, which transitioned us to get into the topic of awareness of crime rates in our neighbourhood. Professor Sprague had an awareness of crime rates in his neighbourhood as well as the surrounding areas, but no awareness of hate crimes in his area.  When asked about hate crimes, Professor Sprague hadn’t heard of any. This is mostly because the city would want to cover up any of these issues as it discourages new citizens, as well as the major media coverage of COVID. One point professor Sprague made noticed is that there will be more crimes in areas with higher populations. This was noted and we looked for this when analyzing the data. We concluded that having a common awareness of hate and bias-motivated crimes would be beneficial for the general community to address the issue and know how to stop it. </p>
            </br>

	<p>The interview experience was very productive and we learned more about our topic. Something else that we learned is that it’s important that we don’t promote hate crimes but rather show statistics so we are not targeting any one person but giving numbers so people are aware. We also learned that we should be using the percentage of the population and not the raw data because Centretown has a higher crime rate due to a higher population. Some keywords we found beneficial to recall from the interview were Demographic, Awareness, Neighborhood, Population, and Motivation. Some key phrases we found beneficial to recall from the interview were Motivation towards these crimes, Acknowledgment in the media, COVID in the media, and Percentage of crime rate in Ottawa neighbourhoods.</p>
</br>

	 <p>In our task table, we found there were 3 main tasks. Task 1’s domain was to find the race that's targeted the most each year. The analytic-Task was to Identify the total hate and bias crimes against each race and Identify which race faced more hate and bias crimes. For the Search-Task, the location is known from the Ottawa neighbourhoods, but the target is unknown as the user can browse the visualization to show the percentages of each targeted race. For the Analysis-Task, the users will discover the different targeted races in hate and bias crimes in Ottawa neighbourhoods when looking at the visualization, showing the percentages each year.</p>
 </br>

<p>Task 2’s domain was Displaying the police-reported hate and bias rate on a map of Ottawa neighbourhoods. The Analytic-Task was to compare the rate of hate crimes within each neighbourhood. For the Search-Task, the location is known from the various Ottawa neighbourhoods, the target is unknown since we are not targeting anyone in the neighbourhood. The user can browse the map visualization. For the Analyze-Task, the users will discover the police-reported hate and bias rates in different Ottawa neighbourhoods when they browse through the map.</p>
</br>

<p>Task 3 ‘s domain was Motivation for hate and bias. The Analytic-Task was to Identify the total hate crimes by motivation. Compare the total crimes by motivation. Outline the motivation for the most total hate crimes. For the Search-Task, the location is known from the various neighbourhoods in Ottawa. The target is unknown since no specific hate crime is being highlighted. For the Analyze-Task, the users will derive from the motivation for these hate and bias crime statistics that there is a correlation between social and political issues that have an impact on the crime rates. Issues such as poverty as well.

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
          </br>
            <p>Our first step was to decide what data we wanted to focus on from our dataset. We decided to focus on location, hate crime type, motivation, and year. One of our main focuses is on the location and we want to have a map that interacts with another graph that shows the specific data. We developed our own individual sketches using pencil and paper that we thought would best represent the data in a visualization. Afterwards, we met as a group and voted for the single best design that best represented our desired data. </p>
          </br>
            <p>The following three are our top chosen designs:</p>
          </br>
          <center><img src="./img/Sketch1.png" alt="Sketch 1">
                  <img src="./img/Sketch2.png" alt="Sketch 2">
                  <img src="./img/Sketch3.png" alt="Sketch 3"></center>
        </br>
          <p>We decided to create a stacked bar chart as our main graph. After deciding on our favourite sketch, we then developed higher fidelity designs using Tableau based on our original sketch. We all made our own different designs and then decided on the best design as a group. We made sure to follow basic design principles while we were developing our designs. While creating our designs, we made sure our data was accurately represented and there was no outstanding lie factor. We avoided using 3D models as there seemed to be no need for it and would just make our graph more confusing. We made sure the different data sections could be clearly identified using labels. We focused on being able to separate sections with lightness and darkness so it could be visible for people that are RGB colourblind. The final picked design is the same visualization we are using for our website now. The development process for our final copy was slow but was very important to ensure we do not bump into any major errors later in the project.

</p>
          </br>
            <h2>Final Visualization</h2>
          </br>
              <p>For our final visualization, we created an interactive dashboard using a map and a bar graph of Ottawa neighbourhoods. All of our code is hosted on Github and has been downloaded into a zip file. Both of the visualizations were created on Tableau and we used brushing and linking for both visualizations to interact with one another; when you click on a location of the map, the bar graph filters with the map location(s) and displays other information linked. And when you click on any section of the bar graph, the map filters to the location(s) that correlate with the bar graph. To make the visualization work on our webpage, we had to embed the code into our index.html file.</p>
</br>
<p><strong>Walkthrough</strong></p>
</br>
<p>
When you (the user) first click on our webpage, you are informed about the dataset we used and the interactive visualizations we created. When you scroll down, the map and bar graph of Ottawa neighbourhoods are present. On the right side of the visualization, you are presented with different legends. The first legend is of the hate crime types on Ottawa neighbourhoods, consisting of the categories: Age, Language, Mental or Physical Disability, Race/Ethnicity, Religion, Sex, and Sexual Orientation. The next legend is a filter for the bar graph, where you can scroll from left to right or right to left if you want to focus on one year or multiple at once. The last legend is a colour map, which correlates with the bar graph showing dark blue to a lighter blue, distinguishing the colours so you can identify that the dark blue is the year 2015 and light blue is the year 2020.

To use this visualization, you can click on any location on the map (the circles) to uncover the details-on-demand: Hate Crime Type, Location, Hate Crime Motivation, and Year. Once clicked on a location, the bar graph will filter to the bar where this hate crime occurred.
</p>
            </br>
            <center><img src="./img/Walkthrough1.png" alt="Walkthrough Image 1">
                    <img src="./img/Walkthrough2.png" alt="Walkthrough Image 2"></center>
                  </br>

                    <p>To unclick the location, simply click anywhere on the map where it does not have a circle. This will bring everything back to the beginning.

You can do this same action on the bar graph by clicking one area on the bar. Once you click on a bar, the map filters to the year it occurred and the type of hate crime it was. Again, to unclick the location, simply click any white space on the bar graph and this will bring everything back to normal.

To use the “Hate Crime Type” legend, click on any of the filters. For example, by clicking, “Age”, the map and bar graph filter to the “Age” hate crimes.
</p>
</br>
<center><img src="./img/Walkthrough3.png" alt="Walkthrough Image 3">
        <img src="./img/Walkthrough4.png" alt="Walkthrough Image 4">
        <img src="./img/Walkthrough5.png" alt="Walkthrough Image 5"></center>
      </br>

        <p>In this instance, the map shows two age-related hate crimes, and the bar graph filtered to the “Children” and the “Unknown Age” sections on the x-axis. To unclick the hate crime type, simply click “Age” for the second time. This will bring everything back to normal.
        </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          </br>
              <p>Much progress has been made from Sprint 1, our group was able to accomplish our most important and necessary task of connecting the map and bar chart to an interactive dashboard which can filter, zoom (the map), and provide details on demand for both visualizations, and aim to connect our third visualization to the dashboard next. In addition, there were also some stylistic and written elements that were added to our webpage from Sprint 1 to provide better context and more information about our project and webpage to users. From the feedback in Sprint 1, there was some critique with how the map was functioning in terms of zooming and panning which unfortunately cannot be fixed due to how Tableau maps function but a remedy/alternative would be to use the tools on the left-hand-side of the map that come with many functions for users to zoom in/out and pan more effectively. For future work, we plan on connecting our third visualization onto the dashboard with the same brushing, linking, and filtering features as the other 2 visualization, we also plan on adding a search bar next to the legend of the map, and from our data analysis, we plan on using the results found during the exploration to be some of the key information found in the data for our ‘highlight’ text.
