            <h2>Task Analysis</h2>
              <p>A summary of interview and task table</p>
            </br>
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
              <p>	Our interview began with discussing what neighbourhoods in Ottawa we were from, which transitioned us to get into the topic of awareness of crime rates in our neighbourhood. Professor Sprague had an awareness of crime rates in his neighbourhood as well as the surrounding areas, but no awareness of hate crimes in his area.  When asked about hate crimes, Professor Sprague hadn’t heard of any. This is mostly because the city would want to cover up any of these issues as it discourages new citizens, as well as the major media coverage of COVID. One point professor Sprague made noticed is that there will be more crimes in areas with higher populations. This was noted and we looked for this when analyzing the data. We concluded that having a common awareness of hate and bias-motivated crimes would be beneficial for the general community to address the issue and know how to stop it.

	The interview experience was very productive and we learned more about our topic. Something else that we learned is that it’s important that we don’t promote hate crimes but rather show statistics so we are not targeting any one person but giving numbers so people are aware. We also learned that we should be using the percentage of the population and not the raw data because Centretown has a higher crime rate due to a higher population. Some keywords we found beneficial to recall from the interview were Demographic, Awareness, Neighborhood, Population, and Motivation. Some key phrases we found beneficial to recall from the interview were Motivation towards these crimes, Acknowledgment in the media, COVID in the media, and Percentage of crime rate in Ottawa neighbourhoods.

	 In our task table, we found there were 3 main tasks. Task 1’s domain was to find the race that's targeted the most each year. The analytic-Task was to Identify the total hate and bias crimes against each race and Identify which race faced more hate and bias crimes. For the Search-Task, the location is known from the Ottawa neighbourhoods, but the target is unknown as the user can browse the visualization to show the percentages of each targeted race. For the Analysis-Task, the users will discover the different targeted races in hate and bias crimes in Ottawa neighbourhoods when looking at the visualization, showing the percentages each year.

Task 2’s domain was Displaying the police-reported hate and bias rate on a map of Ottawa neighbourhoods. The Analytic-Task was to compare the rate of hate crimes within each neighbourhood. For the Search-Task, the location is known from the various Ottawa neighbourhoods, the target is unknown since we are not targeting anyone in the neighbourhood. The user can browse the map visualization. For the Analyze-Task, the users will discover the police-reported hate and bias rates in different Ottawa neighbourhoods when they browse through the map.

Task 3 ‘s domain was Motivation for hate and bias. The Analytic-Task was to Identify the total hate crimes by motivation. Compare the total crimes by motivation. Outline the motivation for the most total hate crimes. For the Search-Task, the location is known from the various neighbourhoods in Ottawa. The target is unknown since no specific hate crime is being highlighted. For the Analyze-Task, the users will derive from the motivation for these hate and bias crime statistics that there is a correlation between social and political issues that have an impact on the crime rates. Issues such as poverty as well.
